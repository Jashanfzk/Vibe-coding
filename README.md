## Game Overview

The Memory Game consists of a grid of cards that are laid face down. Players take turns flipping two cards over at a time, trying to find matching pairs. If a player finds a match, the cards remain face up; if not, they are flipped back over. The game continues until all pairs have been found.

## How to Play

1. Open the `index.html` file in your web browser.
2. Click on any two cards to flip them over.
3. If the cards match, they will remain face up. If they do not match, they will flip back after a short delay.
4. Keep flipping cards until all pairs are found.
5. Try to complete the game in the fewest number of moves!
